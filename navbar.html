      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <div class="alert alert-dark" role="alert">

        Primary evidence for dark matter comes from calculations showing that many galaxies would fly apart, or that they would not have formed or would not move as they do, if they did not contain a large amount of unseen matter. Other lines of evidence include observations in gravitational lensing and in the cosmic microwave background, along with astronomical observations of the observable universe's current structure, the formation and evolution of galaxies, mass location during galactic collisions, and the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters. In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the total mass–energy of the universe contains 5% ordinary matter and energy, 27% dark matter and 68% of a form of energy known as dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of total mass, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95% of total mass–energy content

        Although the existence of dark matter is generally accepted by the scientific community, some astrophysicists, intrigued by certain observations which do not fit some dark matter theories, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity, such as modified Newtonian dynamics, tensor–vector–scalar gravity, or entropic gravity. These models attempt to account for all observations without invoking supplemental non-baryonic matter.

<h2> Dark Matter candidates</h2>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  <h4>WIMPs(Weakly interacting massive particles )</h4>
  When it comes to dark matter, physicists have placed their biggest bets, in terms of research dollars, on WIMPs. These entities surged to the fore in the mid-1980s, connecting the largest, cosmic scale of physics with the smallest, the standard model of particle physics.
  Developed over many decades, the standard model is a stunning scientific success. With pinpoint precision, it describes three of nature’s four forces — electromagnetic, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. But the model also has yawning gaps, including not being able to describe the fourth force, gravity, and failing to explain dark matter at all.
  A refinement of the standard model called supersymmetry smooths over many of its flaws. It fills the gaps by proposing new, heavier partner particles for all known particles. Plug these new heavies into the mix, and, voilà, their total mass strikingly matches the estimates for dark matter. Cosmologists had already been kicking around the idea of WIMPs without knowing what they might be, and suddenly they had a match. Assuming supersymmetry’s heavier partners were WIMPs resolved everything so perfectly, researchers dubbed it the “WIMP miracle.” Conveniently, these WIMPs would interact with normal matter, albeit very weakly as their name implies; such interactions should render them eminently discoverable.

  <h4>Axion</h4>
  After a humble start, the axion is now surging in the race. Physicists originally came up with this particle to help fix a problem with the strong nuclear force, one of nature’s four fundamental forces. The problem is particles that feel the strong force are persnickety; they don’t behave differently when either their electric charges are switched, or they get flipped upside down. The standard model is perfectly cool with this, but it bothered researchers, so they came up with a way to explain that unusual rigidness. As a side effect, the explanation also suggested the universe may be full of new hypothetical particles called axions.
  And, as it happens, axions also fit the bill for dark matter. Although the individual particles have a ridiculously low mass, the universe-forming Big Bang could have churned out axions in dizzying abundance — enough, in fact, to constitute all the dark matter in the cosmos. “A whole lot of the early universe’s energy gets dumped into these particles,” says University of Washington physicist Gray Rybka. “And because they don’t interact very much with anything else, you’d have all this leftover matter kicking about the universe.” Presto: dark matter!

<h4>SIMPs(Strongly interacting massive particles)</h4>
Could physicists be wagering on all the wrong dark matter horses? Hitoshi Murayama, a theoretical physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, thinks so. “There is actually something wrong with the traditional thinking about dark matter,” he says. Along with Yonit Hochberg at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Murayama recently helped develop the SIMP (or strongly interacting massive particles), a whole new breed of dark matter particle.
The top contenders — WIMPs, axions and sterile neutrinos — are all postulated as indivisible, elementary particles. SIMPs, on the other hand, are composite particles, made of other, smaller particles. “A SIMP is really similar to particles we have seen already,” says Murayama. “They’re sort of closer to home.” The most common examples of composite particles? Protons and neutrons, which make up the normal matter around us.
